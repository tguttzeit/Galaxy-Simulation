# Galaxy Simulation

This is a university project from the third semester (2022) at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg, in which a galaxy simulation was implemented.

## Project Description

In this project, a simulation of a galaxy is created. The goal is to model and visualize the movements and interactions of stars and other celestial bodies within a galaxy. The simulation was continuously expanded every two weeks based on assignments. The corresponding jupyter notebooks (written in german) for the presentations can be found in the directory "Abgaben".
